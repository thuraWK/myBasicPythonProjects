# Data Analysis and Visualization with Python

This repository contains a simple data analysis and visualization project that explores salary data for individuals. The project demonstrates basic data analysis using Python, pandas, and matplotlib, with a focus on calculating averages and visualizing salary comparisons through bar charts.

## Project Overview

The project takes in a sample dataset of individuals' names, ages, salaries, and colors, and performs the following tasks:

1. Data Preparation: Creates a pandas DataFrame from a dictionary containing names, ages, salaries, and associated colors.
2. Data Analysis: Calculates the average age and salary of the individuals in the dataset.
3. Data Visualization: Plots a bar chart visualizing the salary of each individual with different colors.

## Features

- Average Age Calculation: Computes the average age of individuals in the dataset.
- Average Salary Calculation: Computes the average salary of individuals in the dataset.
- Bar Chart Visualization: A bar chart visualizes individual salaries with distinct colors for easy comparison.

## Installation

1.Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thuraWK/Salary-Analysis-and-Visualization.git
```

2.Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

To run the project:
Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed (pandas and matplotlib).

Run the Python script to see the output DataFrame and the salary visualization:

```bash
python salary_analysis.py
```

## Example Output

DataFrame:
The dataset will be printed showing names, ages, salaries, and their corresponding colors.

Average Values:
The average age and salary of individuals in the dataset will be calculated and displayed.

Graph:
A bar chart will be generated, showing the salary distribution of individuals, with different colors for each bar.
